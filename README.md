<H1 ALIGN =CENTER>Implementation of Text  Summarization</H1>
<H3>Aim: to perform automatic text summarization using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. </H3> 
 <BR>
<h3>Algorithm:</h3>
Step 1 Import necessary libraries for natural language processing tasks.<BR>
Step 2: Download NLTK resources, including the punkt tokenizer and stopwords.<BR>
Step 3: Define Text Preprocessing Function to tokenize, remove stopwords, and perform stemming.<BR>
Step 4: Define the Text Summarization Function using a simple frequency-based approach.<br>
    - Calculate the frequency of each word in the preprocessed text.<br>
    - Calculate a score for each sentence based on the sum of word frequencies.<br>
    - Select the top N sentences with the highest scores to form the summary.<br>
Step 5: Construct the main program to read the paragraph  and perform text summarization<br>
      - Generate and print the original text.<br>
      - Generate and print the text summary using the  Text Summarization function<br>
